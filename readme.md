# Test Front End

The test took me 48 hrs aproximately.

I decided to merge part 1 and part 2 in only one page as suggested.

I used SASS as a preprocessor, files can be seen in `/css/sass`

## Things I couldn't resolve

In the Desktop Mockup, letters with the `rubik font` appear to be a little bit more stretched than in the page I made.

I've tried using the css font property font-stretch and font-weight but it didn't work.

## Resolutions

I've made 3 working resolutions:

- Desktop: for screens with wider width than `1300px`
- Tablet: for screens with widths between `768px` and `1300px`
- Mobile: for screens with widths smaller than `768px`

## Comentaries

The js code is commented in script.js where i explain how the functions work

In the nav of the header i took the liberty to add a 'BTC PRICE' button that goes to the PART 1 of the TEST(the currency widget)
